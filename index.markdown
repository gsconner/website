# About

<p>My name is George and I'm currently pursuing a job in software engineering.</p>

<p>I went to college at the University of Maryland, College Park. While obtaining my Bachelor's in Computer Science, I built my programming and cyber security skills through classes and events like the Bitcamp hackathon. I also worked on several projects, including my BitTorrent project.</p>

<p>Since graduating, I have spent my time studying other computer science subjects, such as reverse engineering. I've also been working on a game engine in C++.</p>

<p>In addition to programming, I also like to cook and exercise.</p>
